Bear Classifier utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques implemented with FastAI architecture to classify images of bears into three categories: brown, black, or teddy bear. Leveraging data scraped from the internet, our model achieves high accuracy with minimal error rates.

Integrated with Gradio, our classifier offers a user-friendly interface for easy interaction. Users can upload their own images or use default photos to classify bear images instantly. Additionally, our model is hosted on Hugging Face, providing an API endpoint for seamless integration into other applications.
